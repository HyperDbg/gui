- name: MEMORY_TYPE
  short_description: Memory caching type.
  long_description: |
    The processor allows any area of system memory to be cached in the L1, L2, and L3 caches. In individual pages or
    regions of system memory, it allows the type of caching (also called memory type) to be specified.

    short_description: Strong Uncacheable (UC)
    long_description: |
      System memory locations are not cached. All reads and writes appear on the
      system bus and are executed in program order without reordering. No speculative memory accesses, pagetable
      walks, or prefetches of speculated branch targets are made. This type of cache-control is useful for
      memory-mapped I/O devices. When used with normal RAM, it greatly reduces processor performance.

    short_name: WC
    long_name: WRITE_COMBINING
    short_description: Write Combining (WC)
    long_description: |
      System memory locations are not cached (as with uncacheable memory) and
      coherency is not enforced by the processorâ€™s bus coherency protocol. Speculative reads are allowed. Writes
      may be delayed and combined in the write combining buffer (WC buffer) to reduce memory accesses. If the WC
      buffer is partially filled, the writes may be delayed until the next occurrence of a serializing event; such as, an
      SFENCE or MFENCE instruction, CPUID execution, a read or write to uncached memory, an interrupt
      occurrence, or a LOCK instruction execution. This type of cache-control is appropriate for video frame buffers,
      where the order of writes is unimportant as long as the writes update memory so they can be seen on the
      graphics display. This memory type is available in the Pentium Pro and Pentium II
      processors by programming the MTRRs; or in processor families starting from the Pentium III processors by
      programming the MTRRs or by selecting it through the PAT.

  - value: 4
    short_name: WT
    long_name: WRITE_THROUGH
    short_description: Write-through (WT)
    long_description: |
      Writes and reads to and from system memory are cached. Reads come from cache
      lines on cache hits; read misses cause cache fills. Speculative reads are allowed. All writes are written to a
      cache line (when possible) and through to system memory. When writing through to memory, invalid cache
      lines are never filled, and valid cache lines are either filled or invalidated. Write combining is allowed. This type
      of cache-control is appropriate for frame buffers or when there are devices on the system bus that access
      system memory, but do not perform snooping of memory accesses. It enforces coherency between caches in
      the processors and system memory.

  - value: 5
    short_name: WP
    long_name: WRITE_PROTECTED
    short_description: Write protected (WP)
    long_description: |
      Reads come from cache lines when possible, and read misses cause cache fills.
      Writes are propagated to the system bus and cause corresponding cache lines on all processors on the bus to
      be invalidated. Speculative reads are allowed. This memory type is available in processor families starting from
      the P6 family processors by programming the MTRRs.

  - value: 6
    short_name: WB
    long_name: WRITE_BACK
    short_description: Write-back (WB)
    long_description: |
      Writes and reads to and from system memory are cached. Reads come from cache lines
      on cache hits; read misses cause cache fills. Speculative reads are allowed. Write misses cause cache line fills
      (in processor families starting with the P6 family processors), and writes are performed entirely in the cache,
      when possible. Write combining is allowed. The write-back memory type reduces bus traffic by eliminating
      many unnecessary writes to system memory. Writes to a cache line are not immediately forwarded to system
      memory; instead, they are accumulated in the cache. The modified cache lines are written to system memory
      later, when a write-back operation is performed. Write-back operations are triggered when cache lines need to
      be deallocated, such as when new cache lines are being allocated in a cache that is already full. They also are
      triggered by the mechanisms used to maintain cache consistency. This type of cache-control provides the best
      performance, but it requires that all devices that access system memory on the system bus be able to snoop
      memory accesses to insure system memory and cache coherency.

    short_name: UC_MINUS
    long_name: UNCACHEABLE_MINUS
    short_description: Uncacheable (UC-)
    long_description: |
      Has same characteristics as the strong uncacheable (UC) memory type, except that this memory
      type can be overridden by programming the MTRRs for the WC memory type. This memory type is available
      in processor families starting from the Pentium III processors and can only be selected through the PAT.
