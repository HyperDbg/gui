  short_description: 32-Bit Paging
  long_description: |
    A logical processor uses 32-bit paging if CR0.PG = 1 and CR4.PAE = 0. 32-bit paging translates 32-bit linear
    addresses to 40-bit physical addresses. Although 40 bits corresponds to 1 TByte, linear addresses are limited to
    32 bits; at most 4 GBytes of linear-address space may be accessed at any given time.

    32-bit paging uses a hierarchy of paging structures to produce a translation for a linear address. CR3 is used to
    locate the first paging-structure, the page directory.
    32-bit paging may map linear addresses to either 4-KByte pages or 4-MByte pages.
