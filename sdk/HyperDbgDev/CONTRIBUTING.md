# Contribution

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ❤️

HyperDbg is a large-scale project that requires a lot of time and effort from the community. Given the current number of developers and their limited time and resources, we cannot develop every part simultaneously. Therefore, new developers are warmly welcomed to join and add their contributions to the project. Here, we made a list of potential improvements that you can contribute on. Feel free to open up an issue if you think you have any ideas that would make a good addition to the list, or if you want to implement one of the below items, or if you'd like to discuss about a question you might have.

## Things to work on

- Writing blog posts about use-cases of HyperDbg
- Troubleshooting problems with running on Hyper-V's nested virtualization
- Troubleshooting problems with running on VirtualBox's nested virtualization

- Adding an assembler to the project
- Enhancing HyperDbg's [Transparent Mode](https://docs.hyperdbg.org/using-hyperdbg/prerequisites/operation-modes#transparent-mode), especially anti-hypervisor methods
